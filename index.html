            <p class="about-paragraph">Plan Go is an online journal for those who are constantly on the go and would enjoy having a virtual planner. While we love having our paper-version agendas, we saw the opportunity to create an online version with pre-set layouts for ease of creation. Our goal is to be able to have you create and access your entire journal/planner within your phone!<br>
                <br>
            Visit our layouts page to view the pre-set layouts we've created for you to start your planner. Everything from annual, monthly, weekly layouts; meal planners, mental health trackers, gratitude log, goal trackers, etc.<br>
            <br>
            Access your online planner by creating a profile and be able to add pages to your planner, section them as you'd like, and access them on the go!</p>
