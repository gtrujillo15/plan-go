            <p class="about-paragraph">Love planning but find it a strain to take your journal with you? Plan Go is an
                online journal for those who are constantly on the go and would
                enjoy having a virtual planner. While we love having our paper-version agendas, we saw the opportunity
                to create an online version with pre-set layouts for ease of creation. Our goal is to be able to have
                you create and access your entire journal/planner within your phone!</p>
